it is a simple calculator with a simple bunch of automated testing 
to see how the test coverage works

Basically test coverage offers a brief test result showing how the test interacted and if there is any any missing subjects that didn't execute or some cases might be excluded and how many function ran each time and how many statement. 

For our test_calculator coverage was 100% passed
